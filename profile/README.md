🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?

# Hi, Here is NEXT Space 👋

NEXT Space is a unique personal space, can also be used as a personal blog,  continuous update.

*Inspired by [Mix Space](https://github.com/mx-space/).*

We have 2 core repositories:

- [nx-server](https://github.com/wibus-wee/nx-server), a core service for GoldenSpace, provide RESTFul API, power by nestjs
- [nx-admin](https://github.com/wibus-wee/nx-admin), a dashboard for GoldenSpace Service, only provide the most fundamental functions.

Now, we have 0 official frontend style, but you can go to see [nx-web-demo](https://github.com/wibus-wee/GS-web-demo). It's temporary.

- ~~[nx-web-demo](https://github.com/wibus-wee/GS-web-demo), temporary, Working~~
- [nx-A-My](https://github.com/wibus-wee/nx-A-My)

> This Organization's Repository is empty, just moment.

~~Because the organization's limit in Vercel, we only can move official repositories ownership to wibus's.~~

~~The offcial repositories in organization isn't latest, but it will sync once every three days.~~
